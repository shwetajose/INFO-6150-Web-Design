                    <h2>SHWETA JOSE</h2>
                    <p>I am a highly motivated engineer with an appetite to take challenges head-on. I am currently pursuing Master of Science in Information Systems at Northeastern University, Boston.
                        My professional work experience with a proactive middleware team as a Sr Systems Engineer in Bank of America has helped me prove myself in the Information Technology Industry. A chunk of my work revolved around installing, troubleshooting, and maintaining WebSphere, JBoss, and Apache middleware servers. With the energy to do something new in the bank, I took the initiative of configuring data analytics applications using Ansible and XLRelease to ensure that the applications are always in a deployable state. Building development and testing environments on a low-code, enterprise software platform called Appian to develop the bankâ€™s own business to move money between consumers and merchants was one of the most exciting projects I worked on in the bank. 
                        I am interested in database management, software engineering, system design and analysis, and eager to gain experience in these spheres. I devote a lot of time to self-learning concepts I am interested in and give my best effort to projects that I am passionate about.</p>
