                <ul>
                    <li>¾ cup vegetable oil, plus more for pan</li>
                    <li>1⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1¼ cups granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>1¾ tsp. baking powder</li>
                    <li>¼ tsp. baking soda</li>
                    <li>1½ tsp. kosher salt, divided</li>
                    <li>½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1 cup milk</li>
                </ul>

            <p><big><b>Steps:</b></big></p>
            <ul>
                <ol>Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 325°. Using your fingertips, grease bottom and sides of a
                    9" round cake pan with vegetable oil. Line bottom of pan with parchment paper, smoothing to
                    eliminate air bubbles.</ol><br>
                <ol>Whisk 1⅓ cups all-purpose flour, 1¼ cups granulated sugar, 1¾ tsp. baking powder, ¼ tsp. baking
                    soda, and 1¼ tsp. kosher salt in a large bowl. Sift ½ cup cocoa powder into bowl, then whisk to
                    combine. </ol><br>
                <ol>Whisk 2 large eggs, ¾ cup vegetable oil, and 1 tsp. vanilla extract in a medium bowl until well
                    combined and creamy, about 30 seconds. Using a spatula, mix egg mixture into dry ingredients until
                    fully incorporated.</ol><br>
                <ol>Warm 1 cup milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until it comes to just a bare simmer—make sure
                    it doesn’t come to a boil. Whisk warmed milk into batter until lump-free and just combined.</ol><br>
                <ol>Immediately transfer batter to prepared pan. Tap pan a few times on work surface to encourage some
                    of the bubbles to escape.</ol><br>
                <ol>Bake cake, turning pan halfway through, until a cake tester (or toothpick!) inserted into the center
                    of cake comes out clean, 40–50 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan.</ol><br>
                <ol>Meanwhile, make the frosting: Fill a medium pot with 1" water and bring to a bare simmer over medium
                    heat. Combine 4 oz. chocolate chips and ½ cup heavy cream in a heatproof medium bowl, place over
                    saucepan, and reduce heat to low (make sure bottom of bowl is not touching water). Stir occasionally
                    with a spatula until chocolate is melted and mixture is homogeneous and thick. Chill ganache until
                    cool to the touch, about 25 minutes (you can mix with a spatula to encourage cooling). Alternately,
                    mix chocolate and cream in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 10-second bursts until melted.
                </ol><br>
                <ol>Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, whisk 4 oz. (room temperature!) cream cheese, ¼ cup
                    powdered sugar, and remaining ¾ tsp. vanilla extract and ¼ tsp. kosher salt in a large bowl until
                    very smooth and no lumps remain. Beat in cooled chocolate ganache on medium speed, scraping down
                    sides of bowl as needed, until frosting just holds its peak and is well combined and a little
                    thicker, about 1 minute. You don’t want to overbeat because the frosting can become too stiff.</ol>
                <br>
                <ol>Run a butter knife around edges of pan. Invert cooled cake onto a plate and peel off parchment.
                    Invert again onto a platter.</ol><br>
                <ol>Top cake with frosting, spreading evenly across the surface. Make some decorative swooshes with a
                    spoon, if desired. Slice and serve.</ol>
