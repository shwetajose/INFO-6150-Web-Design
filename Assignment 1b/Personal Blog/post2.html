                <p>It was a beautiful morning. The birds were chirping, the gentle breeze was a bit nippy, and all that good stuff, it was the perfect day to go exploring the city on a bicycle. I purchased Bluebikes’ adventure pass and boy an adventure is exactly what I got. About twenty minutes into the ride, I reached a docking station where I decided to leave the cycle and walk around. <br>It was at this moment when everything changed, I noticed that my phone was MISSING. It was not in my puny little pockets where I had put them. I walked back all the way looking for my phone. The Charles River, the puppers on the sidewalk, the colourful tulips, the pink blossoms, none of it seemed as beautiful as it was moments ago. <br>I walked for what felt like forever holding on to my last two braincells. I almost home and before slipping into a wormhole of anxiety, I caught a glimpse of my phone face down on the road. It was the happiest two seconds of my life. The screen was completely smashed, smashed like potatoes. I thought of 100 different ways to fix this problem and realised that it was not worth trying to repair the phone. I had to get a new one.<br> I went home, took a shower, took a nap to process everything only to wake up feeling completely terrible for being so careless. This phone was the first phone I got on my own. I had held on to my old one for longer than I should have just to be able to buy a new one on my own. It was a silly little goal I had set up for myself back in college and I was so proud of myself to achieve it! <br>
                    Take aways? 1) Women’s jeans pockets are not meant to carry stuff, it’s just there for the heck of it. 2) Be more present and be more conscious of your surroundings & belongings, don’t let the puppers (& the shirtless ripped men ofc) take over your mind
