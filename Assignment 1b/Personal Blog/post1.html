                <p>Deciding what the first post should be about was almost as difficult as choosing which restaurant to eat at on a Friday night. Do I share stories about my comfort food, Kabsa and Pepsi? And its Arabian(?) origin? Or stories from my holidays celebrating the temple 
                    festival popularly known as Thrissur Pooram? I could go on and on about its grand display of lavishly adorned elephants, brightly coloured parasols, and the rhythmic beat of the drums that enthrals the crowd, all capped off with a finale of fireworks. I, however, finally settled on sharing the significance of my name.

                    Every kid in our family has a name that is thought through well and discussed at great length. That name for me was "Rachel", the strikingly beautiful shepherdess of Harran. But one day, when my mum was pregnant with me, she watched a Bollywood movie called Criminal. 
                    "Shweta" was the name of the protagonist, and my parents instantly loved the sound of it! To think that my name choices ranged from the Bible to Bollywood is hilarious to me.

                    Interestingly, the Hindu goddess of knowledge and intellect, Saraswati, is also known as Shwetambara. The word "Shweta" which originates from the Sanskrit language stands for the colour white. If you go online, you will see other meanings too, like beautiful, pure, bright, lovable, kind, etc., but I bet all of that is just a bunch of Shwetas editing away.
